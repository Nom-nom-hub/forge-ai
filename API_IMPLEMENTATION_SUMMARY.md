# REST API Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a REST API for ForgeAI that provides programmatic access to code execution capabilities. The API is built using the Gin web framework and includes job management, authentication placeholders, and comprehensive documentation.

## Implementation Details

### New Package

1. **pkg/api**: Contains the REST API implementation
   - `server.go`: API server implementation with routing
   - `jobs.go`: Job management system

### New Command

1. **cmd/api**: Contains the API server entry point
   - `main.go`: API server main function

### Key Features

1. **HTTP Server**:
   - Built with Gin web framework
   - Graceful shutdown handling
   - Middleware for logging and recovery
   - Health and readiness checks

2. **Job Management**:
   - Asynchronous job execution
   - Job status tracking
   - Job cancellation
   - Job listing with filtering

3. **Endpoints**:
   - Root information endpoint
   - Health and readiness checks
   - Language listing
   - Code execution (both direct and file-based)
   - Job status retrieval
   - Job cancellation
   - Job listing
   - Server status

4. **Request/Response Handling**:
   - JSON request parsing
   - Input validation
   - Proper HTTP status codes
   - Consistent response formats

### API Architecture

```
Client -> HTTP Server -> Router -> Handlers -> Job Manager -> Executor
                              -> Response
```

### Job Lifecycle

1. **Job Creation**: Client submits execution request
2. **Job Queuing**: Job is created with "pending" status
3. **Job Execution**: Job is executed asynchronously
4. **Status Updates**: Job status is updated throughout execution
5. **Result Retrieval**: Client can retrieve job results
6. **Job Completion**: Job is marked as completed or failed

### Security Considerations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implemented at the server level
2. **Resource Limits**: Configurable timeout and memory limits
3. **Network Controls**: Network access can be restricted
4. **Authentication**: Placeholders for future implementation
5. **Input Validation**: Request validation to prevent injection

### Error Handling

1. **HTTP Status Codes**: Proper use of HTTP status codes
2. **Error Messages**: Clear, informative error messages
3. **Recovery Middleware**: Automatic recovery from panics
4. **Validation Errors**: Detailed validation error reporting

## Usage Examples

### Start the API Server
```bash
# Build and run
go build -o forgeai-api.exe cmd/api/main.go
./forgeai-api.exe

# Or run directly
go run cmd/api/main.go
```

### Execute Code
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "language": "python",
    "code": "print(\"Hello, World!\")",
    "timeout": 30,
    "memory_limit": 128
  }'
```

### Get Job Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/jobs/job-1234567890
```

### Cancel Job
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/v1/jobs/job-1234567890
```

## Implementation Status

✅ **Core Implementation Complete**
✅ **HTTP Server Working**
✅ **Job Management Implemented**
✅ **All Endpoints Implemented**
✅ **Error Handling Implemented**
✅ **Documentation Created**
✅ **Testing Verified**

## Benefits

1. **Programmatic Access**: Enable integration with other applications
2. **Asynchronous Execution**: Non-blocking job execution
3. **Job Tracking**: Monitor execution status and results
4. **Resource Management**: Control resource usage
5. **Scalability**: Handle multiple concurrent requests
6. **Monitoring**: Health and status endpoints

## Next Steps

1. **Authentication**: Implement API key or JWT authentication
2. **Rate Limiting**: Add more sophisticated rate limiting
3. **WebSocket Support**: Real-time job status updates
4. **Database Integration**: Persistent job storage
5. **Load Balancing**: Support for multiple server instances
6. **Advanced Metrics**: Detailed performance monitoring

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a production-ready REST API that can be extended with additional features as needed.
